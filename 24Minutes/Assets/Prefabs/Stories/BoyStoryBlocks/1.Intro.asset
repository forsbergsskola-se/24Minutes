  storyText: It's raining, but you don't feel the cold. Except for your feet, which
    are completely frozen. You walk towards a silhouette on the ground. It's a child
    playing marbles under the rain. His figure seems blurred, as if it belongs to
    a memory from the past.
  option1Text: Hello, what is your name?
  option2Text: Ey! What are you doing here?
  option3Text: I'm lost. Could you help me?
  option4Text: You observe the child in silence.
