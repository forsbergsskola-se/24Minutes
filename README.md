# 24Minutes
 FInal Exam

In 24Minutes players embark on a mysterious dreamscape. What begins as weird dream soon unravels into a deeper enigma: Who are the shadowy figures you face? Why do they keep peaces of a puzzle? With every encounter and mini-game, you’ll discover these figures aren’t strangers—they’re reflections of yourself.

Art and atmosphere: Inspired by Limbo, the game combines a hauntingly beautiful gothic style with introspective themes.
Enigmatic story: As you complete mini-games and solve puzzles, you piece together who you are, what burdens you carry, and how to embrace yourself.
Unique mini-games that are interconnected 
Each shadow challenges you in a duel through distinct mini-games.

Card game vs. AI: Engage in strategic battles where every choice matters.
Marble physics: Master rebounds and convert marbles to your color while competing against an AI opponent.
Falling letters puzzle: Solve riddles with letters under pressure, racing against time.
Exploration and discovery: Find numbers behind objects in a mysterious church.
Branching dialogue system: Interact with enigmatic characters and uncover crucial clues through conversations that can alter the story.

A layered dream
Between mini-games, players solve narrative and visual puzzles to collect pieces of the key, the central artifact that unlocks the final challenge (currently in development). This vertical slice is just the beginning of a potential series: episodic chapters that explore different dreams, each featuring unique mechanics, characters, and lessons.

Created with passion and learning
This school project was designed to explore and experiment with different mechanics and systems. From realistic marble physics to a fully functional dialogue system, every mini-game evolved significantly during development. For instance:

The rain puzzle game: Redesigned to provide a more meaningful challenge to the player.
Dialogue system: Optimized for easier editing without sacrificing depth.
Card game: Transformed into a strategic, dynamic duel against intelligent AI.
Despite time limitations, the goal was achieved: to create a collection of diverse, interconnected experiences within a cohesive and engaging game.

Next steps
Develop one final music-based mini-game to add even more variety.
Design the ultimate challenge where the key pieces are assembled.
Improve the UI, visuals, and player experience.
Implement music and sound effects to bring the dream world to life.
Add a time factor to the hole experience.

A vision for the future
Morpheus’ Trials could evolve into an episodic mobile game series, accessible and affordable, where each chapter explores new dreams, mechanics, and narratives. Like an escape room, it would blend storytelling and puzzles into a unique, introspective, and memorable experience.
